Hi there! This is Zeropio. I'm a cybersecurity student who is interested in exploring all kinds of low-level topics. Currently, I'm learning about malware development, reversing, and binary exploitation. I will be sharing some of my projects and research on this platform.

If you'd like to know more about me, please check out my [whoami](/whoami) page.
